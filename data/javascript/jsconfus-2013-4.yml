  0:19so it's not spent shell script and i wanna talk about JavaScript eventually
  0:22but first
  0:23I would like to talk about English and not English as we know it but Old
  0:26English
  0:27I it would be unrecognizable
  0:30to you or me in written form or in spoken for but it came from the same
  0:34language family as
  0:36Dutch in German and Icelandic ands
  0:39if things had gone differently modern English would would resemble those
  0:42languages much more closely
  0:44but in the 11th century win the second to say if you want to be king of england
  0:48so he gathered an army in normandy
  0:50and he evaded he invaded the country cross the channel and he won
  0:54and many of those who had fought in his army were rewarded with
  0:57land in power and they became the new ruling class in England
  1:01and they brought with them a dialect of old friends that had a lasting influence
  1:05on English vocabulary
  1:06as Old English evolved into Middle English large numbers a French loanwords
  1:11found their way into the language and its
  1:15over the next few centuries as mailing list became modern English the language
  1:19borrowed more and more words
  1:21mainly from classical sources I
  1:24the transition Feelies will tax from Latin revealed gaps in English
  1:28vocabulary and the simple said solution was to adopt the landward
  1:32in the English but there were people who
  1:35decried what they saw as a bastardization above the English tongue
  1:39and its they call these new words
  1:41in corn terms I any corn being a kind
  1:44inkwell hands so you know a marker I love
  1:48snobbish writer and instead of using these borrowed words they would try to
  1:52resurrects
  1:53archaic words on from English had fallen out of favor or they would try to invent
  1:58new words from
  1:59dramatic roots but these words usually didn't catch on
  2:03on a classical scholar names
  2:06John sheet was one of the most vocal critics love
  2:09in corn terms on ands
  2:13because he's speaking in metaphor here it's not entirely clear to me what he
  2:16thinks will actually happen
  2:18if the worst case comes to pass but nearly five hundred years later
  2:21we can see that english is not declare bankruptcy
  2:25by any means and the way I know this is that she is running in
  2:28early modern English yet we can all read and understand his words very little
  2:32difficulty
  2:33say for the creative spelling a
  2:36but even at the time the purists were in the minority
  2:40i George Petty sums up the rebuttal here I
  2:43he says that the purists
  2:47apply the label in corn terming consistently
  2:50and only for the words that they don't like I he says that half the words in
  2:55English are far from somewhere
  2:56ands only the new borrowings get scrutinized because
  3:00their novelty makes them seem strange he says the borrowing is healthy
  3:05for language but more than that it's on avoidable it's something that all
  3:08languages do
  3:09I know not how we should speak anything without blacking are males
  3:13with Inc so linguistic charism
  3:17lost the battle for English and we now know that their worries were largely
  3:21overblown but for fun sake there's some small corners in the english-speaking
  3:25world who practice what's called
  3:26English which is a English with as few borrowed words
  3:31as possible remaining true to its anglo-saxon roots a
  3:35it's like an alternate history sort of linguistics with the Normans had
  3:38conquered England what my darling would sound like
  3:41there's a will a wiki for English of course and it's called the English much
  3:45Ahmad being an old word for it discussion and the where they have
  3:48decide to use to replace wiki being of Hawaiian Orjan
  3:52a and so we can go there to learn some things about our own country
  3:56an anguish the United States of America will be the band at fault them serve
  3:59america's land
  4:00a and you can learn that that the BF a emerged from thirteen British right
  4:05wings who drafted and acknowledge
  4:07should've sell them in seventeen seventy-six you learn that the leader
  4:12from Eric's Landis forces are Barack Obama if the folk like my pant
  4:16a which is wake or sending an
  4:20then Democratic Party forces sounds like he should be like
  4:23like on a horse or something a but thank you see how ridiculous this gets and how
  4:27quickly
  4:28I'll many years ago we have let's go purists
  4:32in English and they lost they lost in part because they were warning
  4:36love a big nonspecific doom that would come from
  4:40from these evil new words but the only thing that offended them about the words
  4:44was the alien origin they weren't arguing that the words were unclear or
  4:48that they couldn't be use well
  4:50they didn't like the new words because they were new
  4:53I'll so now let's talk about French I
  4:56French is different obviously it dates back to
  5:00just a Julius Caesar's conquest gall in the 1st century BC so it's derived
  5:05mainly from Latin
  5:06but along the way French took a different path
  5:09in 1634 Cardinal Richelieu created by the car look at me for a says
  5:13dedicated to the the purification and preservation a French
  5:18whereas England had largely ignored John cheek and the other doomsayers there was
  5:22one hugely influential Frenchman who declared
  5:25that it was worth it to protect his language from the influence of other
  5:28languages
  5:30the Academy still exists today the french government class
  5:33the official authority on the French language there's no equivalent body
  5:37free English there are people who were these dictionaries in people who read
  5:41grammar books but no one
  5:43who claims to be an authority for all the English spoken and written
  5:46throughout the world
  5:47their 40 seats in the academy and members hold the seat until they die or
  5:51step down
  5:53at which time the other members vote on a replacement they have uniforms
  5:57you are looking at the ceremonial uniform love the members of the Academy
  6:00you can see they take this very seriously
  6:02up and Dave they published the official dictionary of the French language
  6:07I and they have another function that opens them up to ridicule
  6:10they try to prevent the adoption love loanwords
  6:14english-language cultures worldwide and are words
  6:17were on their way into other languages just as Latin words once
  6:20worm their way ours and the Academy tries to keep French
  6:24harmonious by providing French derived equivalence to English loanwords
  6:28this isn't much different from the the efforts have English his linguistic
  6:32purists accept that in French these efforts are blessed by the government
  6:36but the academy lacks any sort of enforcement mechanism
  6:40even within the government so in practice many these recommendations
  6:44are ignored by French speakers a
  6:47in January France France's general commission of terminology and yeltsin's
  6:52announce that use of the word hash tag
  6:55is discouraged among Frank iPhones and the preferred term is
  6:58more DS which literally means sharp word as and the sharp symbol for
  7:03musical notation a
  7:06I'm gonna try to make all this role in to where we are today with our
  7:10with our own language up I have not yet decided
  7:14which these models is better for describing how programming languages
  7:19evolve up on one hand
  7:23they have to be understood by machines and the best way to make sure all
  7:26machines understand the language the same ways to be very specific about how
  7:29the language
  7:30is designed so we need a top-down approach we need standards by
  7:34on the other hand standards bodies don't
  7:37typically try to specify style are coping styles
  7:41are shaped by the acting scripts spec
  7:44the sheets by the code we've read out there in the real world
  7:48coat patterns our folks your driven
  7:51solutions to common problems so we also need
  7:54a robust community in which people are writing
  7:57their own code and reading the code above others
  8:01up after years have minimal change JavaScript
  8:05is involving yes 5 intentionally did not introduced
  8:09new syntax so yes six is the first time
  8:13in over a decade that JavaScript is poised to adopt new syntax this is going
  8:18to feel weird
  8:20it must feel weird because new syntax has to be cleared from on high
  8:25a some other new features are controversial
  8:28and some of them are not and as far as I can tell
  8:32nearly all the on controversial things are the ones that add new features
  8:36maps week max week week maps proxies
  8:39I'll and so on ans in browsers now we've got types arrays
  8:44and support love web GL and the other API's
  8:48the lettuce manipulate binary data and the concept to the type to rate
  8:52is quite foreign to have JavaScript usually works but I've never seen art
  8:57anyone argue the type to raise shouldn't be in JavaScript because
  9:01they were necessary to do the things we wanted to do
  9:04whereas to me most the controversial things are
  9:08the things that merely restate we can already do
  9:13something new syntax is trying to replace patterns that individuals out
  9:17scriptures
  9:17have come up with I the existing patterns
  9:21are big closing and they don't look quite as nice but we invented them
  9:24ourselves and so it feels strange to have something
  9:29come out to replace all that work it feels like look at the front says is
  9:32telling us not to use the words that we came up with ourselves
  9:37on so the best example might be
  9:41the proposal for I'll what's called maximally minimal
  9:46classes their call maximally minimal because the pro the proposing tax is a
  9:50very tiny
  9:52evolution over how people make class is an existing JavaScript
  9:55I you can see the existing syntax on the left and proposing tax on the right
  9:59they are functionally equivalent
  10:02no new features are introduced there's no confusing
  10:06new semantics there's no gotcha is this a shortcut syntax
  10:10it doesn't replace protable inheritance it's just too restatements
  10:14a pro two players under the hood it's nothing but prototypes
  10:19up in theory this is about as on threatening
  10:23as new syntax is going to get in its their
  10:26are couple new keywords that are introduced but their words that were
  10:29reserves by JavaScript years ago and its
  10:33if we don't use them to just going to go to waste and
  10:36the door is open for the syntax to be extended in future
  10:41I right now there's no built-in way to class methods but a future version
  10:44a good script could introduce class methods through
  10:48new syntax without breaking backward compatibility
  10:52I'll but I hear a pulse there are
  10:56there are a number of reasons that you can be against the the
  10:59classes proposal but the real the one that I read the most is the one that
  11:03makes least
  11:04sense to me on class-based inheritances and JavaScript pattern that has existed
  11:09for years
  11:11its a subset of protable inheritance and I know that because we've been using
  11:15prototype one hair dance to
  11:16emulates class-based inheritance the straw man used
  11:203 that GS is the example but you can look hats
  11:23a backbone or jQuery UI or
  11:27a half-dozen frameworks that everyone in this room has use
  11:30and we can talk about whether it's a good pattern
  11:34on the merits bites it drives me nuts when I see simplistic
  11:37opposition based on one person's
  11:41subjective idea above what JavaScript is
  11:44and isn't ands even if you think jugs
  11:48I that classes are real job scripts opposing the syntax isn't going to make
  11:52them go away
  11:54they already exist in half love your favorite libraries
  11:57on the most common rebuttal I see is from people who can't disentangle the
  12:03idea
  12:04have classes from job they see the world class and
  12:07they get shellshock ans flashback to
  12:11some horrible internship where they ad spend all day eclipse reading
  12:14getter and setter methods a
  12:19so yet crew this is the thing I was clearly working up to
  12:22this it but this isn't just about classes on
  12:26the classes are the best example if you say classes will turn Javascript
  12:29into Java your a modern-day John chic
  12:32you're attacking the new words because they come from a different language the
  12:36don't like JavaScript is not Java
  12:39and it wants turn into Java just because we add syntax
  12:43for the classes that people are already writing
  12:47the status quo have JavaScript the language that the purists are trying to
  12:51protect
  12:51is a language that has already borrowed
  12:54half its syntax from Java ands
  12:59I ahead for chose features and that's how it's it'll continue to work
  13:03on default parameters are coming be already exist in a bunch of other
  13:07languages
  13:08I array comprehension zan generators are coming over from
  13:11iPhone yes six is not going is not inventing new things at Finnair
  13:16I it's taking things that work in other languages and
  13:19applying them to our own we are going to black are males with Inc no matter what
  13:24we do
  13:27on so here's the problem on
  13:30introducing new syntax to JavaScript is going to be hard for the same reason
  13:34that look at me. Francaise has trouble getting people to use their words
  13:39a we're gonna have new syntax for classes and modules by
  13:42in our work in our world we already have several different ways have
  13:46do in class going Cairns and several different ways a modular rising
  13:49code a and reminds me of something else happening
  13:53in English me whatever first to some person who is hypothetical
  13:57or whose gender you don't know we've got a few options
  14:00I'll all their grammar books will tell you that's
  14:04a the third person singular masculine
  14:07can be used to refer to a person indeterminate
  14:11gender but this is this is falling out of favor
  14:14on it can be semantically awkward and
  14:17their people who think it perpetuates thinking if men as the default
  14:20and women is a special case so a
  14:24some people taken upon themselves to advance new
  14:27a new gender-neutral program for English and
  14:31a mathematician at Michael Spivak popularize the idea of taking the third
  14:34person for als
  14:35them they and their and dropping the TH
  14:39to turn each one into a gender-neutral Cingular
  14:43a which is pretty simple and
  14:46arguably pretty elegant but the practice is not caught on
  14:50I'll instead was caught on is to
  14:54is a even to say he or she in each instance
  14:57or more commonly to use what's called the singular obey
  15:01I 3 to repurpose their present for all
  15:04as the person singular a
  15:08it's not hard to argue that singular they is not the most well-designed
  15:12solution but
  15:13that's the thing it didn't win because it was elegant one because
  15:16it's the solution that is most familiar English speakers
  15:20and because it doesn't require the teaching of an entirely new
  15:23word the singular the usage was able to spread organically through
  15:26popular use up and to bring us back to JavaScript I think we overlook
  15:32that that even though job script is written four machines to understand
  15:37on everyone a javascript that's written adds to a giant corpus
  15:41both Co that other people can read you probably learned English from a grammar
  15:45book or a text book but you became an expert
  15:48and English through reading books and watching movies and talking to people
  15:52around you
  15:53in English I likewise you may have one had a code from a book but you develop
  15:58your coding skills by reading the code of those around you
  16:02I if I were trying to introduce a new word in the English
  16:06I would trade a to convince a high-profile source to start using it I
  16:10would
  16:11get into dictionary so I would make it part of Associated Press
  16:16style I get a major news outlets use regularly
  16:19I'll time at time magazine spend was the 20th century trying to point
  16:23new words up their own and stay they had more misses than hits but they're
  16:27credited with inventing
  16:29words like socialite and and televangelist
  16:32I so it helps to have major firepower behind new words but its
  16:36it's no guarantee that they'll catch on up
  16:40ideally people realize that the new word represent something
  16:44that deserves to have a name and they start to use it before they have time to
  16:48come up with something else
  16:49but that's a lot of maybe's if it doesn't quite work out then
  16:52a you end up looking like an idiot
  16:55yep the using this Disney worthy even that no one understands
  17:00what it means I'll so if the people in this room
  17:04wields any influence a and I i think they do then
  17:08we're going to be an important part what happens when
  17:12yes six this file if you don't like some other new stuff that's fine
  17:16even pretend it doesn't exist I you're not obligated to do anything but if you
  17:20like the new class in tax or the new module syntax
  17:24or the structuring or blocks Cooper whatever then you can do some simple
  17:27things to help them along
  17:29you can write documentation a and the end is probably gonna have discovered
  17:34but its it's not just the reference documentation its blog posts
  17:37its Stack Overflow tutorials code recipes
  17:41anything like that no matter how trivial the no matter how trivial
  17:44you think it is because whether this will be brand new
  17:48to I'll a lot of developers and they're gonna google it
  17:51and there should be concept there up
  17:55if you're in an environment that will get new syntax quickly like node
  17:59then you don't have much of an excuse not to
  18:03a to be the syntactic change that you wanna see
  18:08a if you write for the browser it's not as easy but
  18:11on once yes six is
  18:14finalize I hope we can come together around a canonical transpire that will
  18:19I that will let us all right yes six or some reasonable subsidy a6
  18:24and get transpired over two years 34 environments that needed
  18:28a and hopefully this will be in the near future when all browsers
  18:32support source maps that we can do it as painlessly as possible
  18:35up but here's the most important part be a therapist
  18:40people fear change we hang around
  18:43and we talk about this stuff for conferences and on mailing lists on
  18:46Twitter
  18:47arm and its all stuff to us
  18:50but when its unveiled to the rest of the world there's going to be
  18:54a backlash too many people it's going to seem jarring and strange
  18:58your they just learn JavaScript a couple years ago and it's right as they thought
  19:02they were getting the hang of it there's this new scary thing that reminds them
  19:04up the Java world
  19:06they left behind I want you to hug them tightly
  19:09and whisper it's not your fault
  19:12over and over again tell them it's going to be okay
  19:16tell them they don't have to be scared by
  19:19new modest and
  19:22optional enhancements it's still going to look and feel like JavaScript
  19:27ands the next time that you worry about where jobs get this going remember that
  19:31five hundred years later we can still
  19:32read the words of John G the language you love is not going anywhere
  19:37and I think I came in just under time
  19:42so that's all for me
