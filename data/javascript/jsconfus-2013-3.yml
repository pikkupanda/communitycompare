  0:19so I actually went to task of 2012
  0:23I attended a I'm it was my first
  0:26conference ever as anything and i sat there
  0:29totally shot I never talk to a person single person so
  0:32you told me that this year I Beyonce's presenting than now
  0:36I would be very surprised I'm
  0:41I um centrist we sow visiting
  0:45for horning I'm what have Jack character in Austin James Joyce Richard Feynman
  0:50of kind of some Johnson I missed ernest hemingway got in common
  0:54and I'll the reason I sent that is because I hope song we have a very
  0:58clever answer for me
  1:00so I could say on stage but I got this which is pretty good because
  1:04a.m. fail my office good I have which
  1:08we should actually as you'll see is natos
  1:11far from the truth as you might think so
  1:17I am NOT this talk I am started
  1:20way back August 2012 a
  1:24I was talking to fans on IRC and yes what I was doing
  1:27and I said oh I just wrote a piece of JavaScript and thus far love
  1:32above above earnest how hemingway
  1:36and he was aiight great you should like to post
  1:40and it was a I'm not that she hadn't written apiece jobs goodness on the
  1:43Venice I was just thinking about
  1:45how that would work hadn't done it all I thought ok right now I have to go I'm
  1:49writer
  1:49so I did and it became a blog posts and it became very successful
  1:55post I'm on the fun to pack a month in bunch of other stuff
  1:58so from that um
  2:01came this talk and
  2:05today I'm gonna present I'm gonna have come to you reviews
  2:09from five of us the five authors in that talk
  2:13am and
  2:16plus especially for this talk I promise to buy another five
  2:20doing another exercise um
  2:23I got seven in the and I couldn't narrow it down so
  2:27hopefully we have time arm so
  2:32a here are his the mother a vocoder views
  2:35a the office sent me back I heard set me back
  2:39to from history the
  2:42a their answers to two problems and we're going to do a code review
  2:46on them so
  2:49exercise 1 is given out your numbers return the Fibonacci sequence
  2:54for the argument given argument which is the
  2:57number for science of the sequence first up
  3:02is ernest hemingway these are all close these all-natural
  3:05actual quotes I think they with a MIDI I just
  3:10change the earth inglewood
  3:14is time sometimes it in even change anything anything and
  3:19I think these quotes go a little bit what a little bit of the way towards
  3:23explaining
  3:24that approach to solving the problem so let's look at furnace
  3:28arm attendance the sewing financing so it doesn't you know having way he's very
  3:33spare
  3:34I'm he a he
  3:37he is very economical any tells you what you have to know
  3:41for No comments: because he was a proponent of the iceberg theory
  3:46which is that them minimum
  3:50possible amount is on the surface the rest is for the Eve
  3:54reader to discover hidden beneath the surface
  3:59I am very straightforward
  4:02he names his for tables exactly as you as you would expect for second
  4:08not trying to be clever not trying to use any terminology
  4:11and its technique called terminology it's a very nice solution
  4:16if the size is less than two fibonacci
  4:19I'm you know he could give you the answer but he feels
  4:23you were an idiot for asking so that's what you gonna get back
  4:27next up is shakespeare
  4:31that is a natural that's a natural quote from
  4:34shakespeare I'm
  4:38so he kinda drags this this one out I was only safe pecan
  4:42I am calculation to axe implying the hematological
  4:46JavaScript and he introduces the cake
  4:50characters he has the to not just assign a
  4:53the main protagonists are the result which is in a way
  4:58which is going to return to you an account on as he can so we can count
  5:02through
  5:02the fall open and as I miss a spirit with bowknot use only 6 p.m. but I
  5:06suspended
  5:08he and divided the center interacts
  5:11sacked once it is Magic School Bus yes
  5:15so night long I in with 20 2004
  5:18say a initiation
  5:21I resist a long way of saying his assigning 0 votes
  5:25to the result and by the way um
  5:28almost always come comments when I iambic
  5:32penned time into which is the way shakespeare wrote
  5:35I'm thank you
  5:38we says ten syllables basically pearl I'm
  5:41an stress every other syllable hands
  5:45pentameter five syllables stressed
  5:48he didn't always stick exactly tuna and he has in the comments the point is to
  5:52emphasize certain words
  5:54by by a switching the stress
  5:57um clothes were so let's go by on tack to
  6:02K in which um it
  6:05every iteration ILU two numbers are queries
  6:09and some ands by divination he sets
  6:12at joining members as as he says
  6:16and I am its it's pretty nice code I guess
  6:20and as a bit above obfuscation going on I'm
  6:23the reason he's doing this all from mathematics
  6:270 down there is that um
  6:30he doesn't want 0 all we've
  6:34pope warm becomes a vast so
  6:37that fast what he's doing that and then finally
  6:40and that he returns the result to you
  6:44and then there's a players exit
  6:48and does the end
  6:51now um
  6:54his/her dove on on tape press on
  6:58I he was a mid-century France
  7:03surrealist I one of the family members of those
  7:06servicemen movement and he believe dreams were more interesting them
  7:11he movement payouts BR to a
  7:16so will his pros have a very dream-like quality to them
  7:20and you actually switches nouns for
  7:23any other words you can think of
  7:28so this is what we got so
  7:31factor will he be named factorial tick
  7:35colette which became the first 10 for time affairs
  7:39and but the amazing thing is and why I really like his writing is there's a
  7:43certain elegance to it
  7:44I mean he chooses his nouns carefully
  7:47am under the firm the whole politics logic to it you'll see how staircase
  7:52for the iterator the thing the the you for you
  7:56increase meant and I think only know he's done
  8:00pretty nicely has a very nice answer
  8:04um next I'm onto the terrain
  8:08also rubber-stamp
  8:14pearl onions one in my personal heifetz
  8:18I am and Bologna a has a wonderful style he's
  8:22charming naive on
  8:26incredibly honest and every aspect a few month
  8:30frailties included he'll tell you what he's thinking the whole the whole time
  8:34the most personal um seemingly uninteresting took thought so
  8:38Hill hello share with the SEC is comments are
  8:41very much an invite and that kinda stuff also I
  8:45he loved the open her it's the old roof
  8:48right as any historical figure so is actually named his factorial after
  8:53certainly in our tips on nope
  9:02piccolo who was as you there person who credited with with
  9:07identifying the have not you serious
  9:11am so if elmo is less than 0 pping the size her
  9:15Evo is less than 0 the he he doesn't want to answer that because he doesn't
  9:19know how to answer
  9:20although he admits that several
  9:23responses probably have a nice response is a curse him
  9:27and then he just tries to Cody doesn't really care about the code if you missus
  9:30books like the plot is
  9:32almost sidelines he just he just
  9:36writes the code in short order I am and then
  9:40I am says he doesn't really understand what's going on
  9:43and then he he left heel heedless a lot of mathematicians
  9:47which very interested I am
  9:51and this is his kinda deal this this is how he works in it
  9:54it in his book I he pays
  9:58ha March 2 to these people and then he returns the answer
  10:03is that I didn't really know what how many this thing work better anywhere has
  10:06the answer cuz you're interested
  10:08and he said damn honesty site he can help looking a bit further
  10:12down the page even though actually at I think nothing happens in
  10:15just points out for there was nothing happening and he would rather not talk
  10:19about it even if it was
  10:21as this is a very personal style offense
  10:24so onto Charles child takings
  10:28I'm Charles Dickens I don't really like his work that much he's very superficial
  10:32Henry James called him the greatest subversive for superficial mmm
  10:36novelists i think is like a substance of hotties make the building
  10:41um characters has great great characters
  10:44but he doesn't do anything with them to my mind and
  10:48um the lack of honesty and I like I'm understanding I think somewhere that
  10:53so we can see what he does here his he
  10:56a ignores the principal up the have been out you serious if I
  11:00adventure that he doesn't really understand their
  11:03but he didn't notice that I am every number in the series
  11:07is almost exactly 1.61 80 three times the previous number
  11:12in the series so again very superficially just use that to build the
  11:17series and there we have it so
  11:21fact is that and now exercise too so there is among those above the 5 posts
  11:26from the
  11:26previous blog that I votes and these now are
  11:297 code reviews that have just being sent to me
  11:34for the next exercise so I have no idea what's on the Sony out
  11:37I'll be seeing it for the first first time to exercise to
  11:41is a factorial serve a given argument and
  11:46return the factorial
  11:50and let's start with cake
  11:53Kovach the Jack
  11:57karach am now co uk had a very
  12:01a spontaneous
  12:05stream of conscious style
  12:08and he didn't think I have so if there isn't a function here
  12:14like ok
  12:18he thank you
  12:21so from it looks like he has nicely prepared
  12:26any other examples they would only work for any cause
  12:2943
  12:33and and he's put a whole other comments in here too
  12:37and it's really hard to figure out what is code in White's comment
  12:41but eventually sort of works
  12:44the kinda stream that and and there is an answer yet she tells it the answer
  12:49a before he gets here a
  12:53so there we are that's a correct so yeah I i mean
  12:56its okay so here is
  13:00James Joyce I'm this is a particularly nice
  13:05pro actually has I I don't know how many familiar with him
  13:10with the vocal fight is a time so it's the one thing you like to do a lot with
  13:14make up these poem anti words which is like two words combined
  13:19and it looks like he's actually taken into its coding is using now
  13:22and a lot of places so this is a hack on the
  13:26factorial you 33 Korea a factorial
  13:30and he wants you to pass a small in future is the argument is a BigInteger
  13:34it's now it's just gonna blow the whole thing up so
  13:37that's why is calling it an Inc said
  13:40jet hen strongly that small engine should be passed
  13:44I he's returning a South policies have to sign it's not so why is doing
  13:49actually because it doesn't really help but
  13:52whatever those thoughts the way things are he's got the we've
  13:56Press ok to fusion which is fight the the amalgam of
  13:59resultant ok computation
  14:03and now if you pass fairer and no one really understands
  14:08to be honest the wind factor in 2002
  14:12ponies in with just one of those things says behold the stranger with
  14:17heroin psych the strains in dangerous
  14:20cerro but no one really understands that I'm just kinda hard coat that
  14:24and then connected I by multi cables I'm no one is saying that
  14:30but I guess what he's doing is insisting I am straightforward
  14:34a for loop I counting down and multiplying up
  14:38for everything that he finds I'm
  14:42and that's the answer really but it looks like he's done something else here
  14:45I'm procedures okay is some
  14:50yeah Cup his cover theater
  14:53shillings and pens which is the the currency that was around at the time he
  14:58was actually writing
  15:00now actually when you think about this this makes no sense because every factor
  15:04I before i think is divisible by 12
  15:07and the twelve shillings in at 12 pennies and shelling
  15:10so he realizes the settings is a pretty good way to express
  15:14results for fact oil I am he's doing a lot of
  15:19arm crazy shit you see he doesn't actually
  15:22use functions in the as functions decorations he is a constructor he is a
  15:27function construct a hacer
  15:29and I'm god only knows why
  15:33a but it seems it seems to work and and then he I'm
  15:37and then he he passes all the nah now for characters out there
  15:42and then guess the answer own he always likes to throw in these
  15:45superb momentos light at the end which is like a buncha stuff combined all that
  15:50ok hickok like a staff a
  15:53fastest Harry Reid's in answer there then we have some some
  15:59examples I'm and it's actually a its okay
  16:02soaking and now we have a Richard Feynman
  16:06have whose not a
  16:09novelist or up poet but a very interesting I have a great respect for
  16:15in specially
  16:16the way I and this quote sums it up a
  16:19things are going to sum up his post the answer is never pays attention to
  16:23anything by X
  16:24butts programs everything himself
  16:27and soda and and
  16:31he is this approximation to calculate
  16:34factorial and has got a fact lol or as chief
  16:38factor Ryo I am because
  16:41its doesn't just work for interest shows it works for
  16:44of actions to and i think is pretty damn
  16:49clever from very scientific approach and so that we can see we can see and that
  16:55the any promises sorry information
  16:57so I'm so we're all kinda familiar with this
  17:01for 36 points there is there is there were five but now he can
  17:05cover the two I'm photos love above
  17:08in known into just two which is really great
  17:11um now we have of the kinds of oil
  17:15who I am the author of the
  17:19solar comes stories and I think
  17:23um he's done something a little bit ours here he's here I so problems he likes to
  17:28work
  17:29pack with food problems so factorial doesn't in just 10
  17:33he wants give me the answer sir fitzroy and I will give you the un factor I will
  17:37work
  17:38pop backwards to determine what was the number that actually
  17:42see that this fact oil and
  17:45he uses a couple things that beginning just as well
  17:49you won't understand his first tooth I'm just gonna put them in a hot cousin
  17:52house
  17:53and then and he goes to the real I'm facto function
  17:57and he was a humble guy basically well
  18:00I'm you know he was somewhere and and
  18:03if test the number one
  18:08is the argument then he doesn't know what it could be cuz it could be 0a like
  18:13could be Wong sorry this has to Watson he is also lost and then
  18:19um second his second from parts his methodology
  18:25was to look from ha jiggle president so we have a case like this
  18:30go back to the case history we haven't had one like this before
  18:33because he's catching on to the old answers he straightway looks in the in
  18:36the case history
  18:37fine salt solutions I'm and then he eliminates the impossible
  18:43so a actually any fight so over
  18:46for which is all we're left with now is divisible by 24
  18:50so and this is if it if it's our 0 not visible by 24
  18:55then he's a shower since this is not the answer to
  18:59of a factorial finally
  19:02a he knows it's a real factorial and he will work backwards and
  19:06to choose the answer I am
  19:10but even then if it doesn't come up to a whole number
  19:13or say if some the the nominee Mitt the numerator and denominator do not match
  19:19by continued dividing the right to buy domains than he knows
  19:22your an imposter to and that wasn't a real fitzroy and many adds it to the
  19:27case history and then he returns the answer
  19:28that's figures okay
  19:32now and his some examples for him now
  19:38home Johnson Simon Johnson was a seventeenth-century
  19:44Vita some you may have heard event he
  19:47compose a dictionary he wrote the first section one of the first
  19:50first section is back in seventeen hundred's and had a very famous quote
  19:54when one is how I have JavaScript one is
  19:56tired of life and
  20:00thing about summer Johnson is a hung around Inc
  20:05coffee shops a lot of do is work in coffee shops
  20:09and also he I am he really did not like the
  20:14in lab what languages contemporaries were using the tender to use
  20:17I am lab with some historical language and he liked very clean
  20:22very clipped kinda language so CoffeeScript was
  20:25perfect for him so he sees office could solve a problem
  20:29the irony is he like very simple language when we look back now on how we
  20:33use to write it looks kinda if
  20:35old-fashioned and and and inches am
  20:38he's a bit sarcastic I ingenious of a three to prove the palpably
  20:42of PS I'm if the number is
  20:46it would born is the argument then that's the answer
  20:50he also took an entry for his dictionary in that put in the comments 0
  20:54because in he defined that from his diction
  21:00and a and you can see a little bit if like
  21:04site is scathing wit bad to worse we custom he's not totally solve the net
  21:08but I'm
  21:11it solves this problem
  21:16so now at chain all said nothing about Jane Austen
  21:19and wells because she will be
  21:28pose in the mail dominated world
  21:31um she felt she had to hide her cleverness from the world
  21:35but she she did it in a very
  21:38I'm I this is almost Odrick
  21:42cuz this time in here because program misperceived shows most
  21:46misfortune knowing anything to consider as well as you can
  21:49which is not merely saying that she's considering the fact that that
  21:53she knows you shouldn't do that and we can see losses
  21:56examples and and she'd should cover days a lot cheaper it is the conventions of
  22:02the
  22:02time and so you see she parodies
  22:05um that peasantry
  22:09love JavaScript community
  22:13I am the fact the usual some people say you should use triple equals for
  22:17everything
  22:18I'm she's pretending she thinks that's actually true she knows probably what's
  22:22known she doesn't have
  22:23to do that I am she even text to see where the argument is an
  22:27is an actual number or not knowing that it could not be number
  22:33I am yeah
  22:37and so there's a certain mister crawford
  22:42I'm who says whenever we have a we have an a4
  22:45for it we should check for I'm in case was inherited from
  22:49the party sites so a mmm
  22:52she's pretending that she thinks she should password you should do here
  22:57and then she carries on the cussing until the answer comes out
  23:02and it's a very nice we just go back one
  23:05I'm as with a rising it's very well is very well-crafted
  23:09um she's yes South invoking function take as a kind ok
  23:13closure so even the um
  23:16click cashing in everything is completely
  23:21it enclosed are put in this is a very
  23:25tidy function
  23:29and then finally I am back to Ernest
  23:34Kong keeping now he wants to send began I didn't actually asking buddy some semi
  23:37and other responses 1
  23:39so I am and again
  23:43ernest Hemingway's very spur very economical
  23:46I that's how we did it not have you ever
  23:51a extra staff a he doesn't have any might be slightly slower
  23:56because this nation he wants it to be clean wanted to despair
  24:00and that's why we have
  24:03and fan said and his some resources you might want to look at
