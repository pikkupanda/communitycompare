  0:19so um yeah I'm here to talk about my
  0:23my let the lessons I learn on the experiment lech and
  0:26and it's mostly web RTC their I was in a project recently and
  0:31learn a few things with web RTC I wanna share originally the talk I wanna give
  0:36was about 10 assists and what technology
  0:38but have of research to kind of put it all together probably something most
  0:41talked about that start doing it
  0:44some point but talk to me later on in the day so
  0:47I'm this whole thing came together with their
  0:52basically at gave who had some people
  0:55approach developers and a basis said
  0:59we want you to build an experiment wanna pay you some money to do it
  1:03want to use COO technology and
  1:06my web browsers we're gonna showed off a Google i/o you're interested
  1:10sounds like mmm damn I where be paid
  1:14hell yes sorry pretty easy at decision and and
  1:17at that point it there was I respect it was just use whatever technology you you
  1:21want to be with GL
  1:22it could be and sis at 36 s
  1:25and and I chose to use when RTC
  1:29I'm I'm running the that the game in the back roads that mean idea of watching
  1:32bill
  1:33am one idea we had was to use T Mobile phones gonna light saber si easy
  1:38orientation events and kinda the way they
  1:40their web or you AP archive work out but the to find two collided in
  1:45invisible light saber but in the end I like the idea of them
  1:48actually putting someone's face inside of the
  1:51a mobile phone in and having having people kinda
  1:54for things out that face and is based off a firm
  1:58II nothing remembers the the of the Facebook game where
  2:02and for about 2008 principal game he said
  2:05oxygen either in use for both chose face it's called Facebook
  2:09so I kinda wrecks of the idea and
  2:12and the idea is simply three balls each other's face
  2:16first one to three wins and it uses
  2:20well TC audio/video at Pita Pit data
  2:23retention events a whole bunch of other pets have technology so surreal kind of
  2:26them
  2:27at just demo with basically and
  2:30Hauge one big caveat: for this talk as well I'm not gonna be talking about
  2:35call was like storm service I was just making Star Trek
  2:39and time servers our turn the security protocols
  2:44this is a this is from a web developers point of view a
  2:48and is what we can do with those why did was burning building bricks how iconic
  2:53couple things together without really
  2:54fully understanding of the technology there and how I got away with a and
  2:58and I I was watching my son and put some
  3:02mean for your put some bricks into this that the space wall is gone
  3:06and I realize that might myy developers
  3:09pretty similar where a basic just take a piece technology a ram against the wall
  3:13until it fits through I just keep turning in pushing eventually job search
  3:17and bats
  3:18basically my programming approach he's got it you know age twenty months
  3:22and occasionally take a shape that doesn't quite fit the whole just push in
  3:25if it's any website
  3:27you know it works and sir it means the
  3:31I will quite happily take where RTC and put into a project without
  3:36needing to understand how its doing well as communication
  3:40just another that actually works and at this is that
  3:44this high-level version that talk by SME so
  3:47that doesn't mean that retrospectively I want it back look at the technology in
  3:51trying to understand it
  3:52it's just this I knew that I Disney kinda shook up
  3:55and want to come in at a high level basement so
  4:00this there were two tranches of work in this project than
  4:03that course the pain I guess is for the best way ever happening
  4:07the real-time communications I think so
  4:11web RTC which this talk we mostly a bow
  4:15I'm and hope will have time to go to the graphic stuff
  4:18a few few nice but graphics performance because the target platforms
  4:22because it was the Google i/o is a you can't give a nexus for 17 hours left
  4:25that
  4:26here approx I found some interesting things in
  4:29times for miss that I'm again because it was a
  4:34it was damning where only had to at least work
  4:37in II giggle crime for
  4:41Android be to and this technologies under a
  4:44you know Assange's fact that you have to physically go in and in neighboring this
  4:47so it's great for me in terms of plot playground but
  4:50obviously it's not going over works in every single browse this point I'm
  4:54am BUP at the moment the game works on
  4:58crime franjo repeater I D plans at support for I West's you know the old
  5:03ok browser the older platform and
  5:06and should work in Firefox but not test this iE you know if you do
  5:10have a look at the links at the end and doesn't work for Fox is because
  5:13I'm tested at all a plan see
  5:17sucked when RTC
  5:20this amazing technology is so I'm
  5:24ESP too early to take another interesting right and
  5:28this three main API's inside when RTC there's
  5:31get media get use a media which is access to the
  5:35and the webcam the microphone
  5:38basic thing the flash head for yes I 10 years and
  5:42I think well certainly get you to me was kind of start emerge
  5:46last year its E its the API sky stable
  5:50you can use in and a green browse it's a quite happily
  5:54and I got some example code but the Rio that the wealthy seaside things over to
  5:59other APIs which are the pic connection API
  6:02which is want to go to stream from your machine we can send of
  6:06to another user in the room sorry its it's literally pay sick pay which means
  6:10they're known
  6:11that you don't need to serve a flat days ago from one device to another
  6:14site my laptop can stream video to you Michael fine
  6:18inside this local network without going varsa
  6:22and then the third API's days channel API which
  6:25days the say it's basically sockets
  6:29over that pits a pair and the interesting part is
  6:32it's a it's ability to you you TP which is an appeal for
  6:36game developers and I appreciate their game and I'm not games developer I'm I'm
  6:41very much just hack and see what sticks
  6:43and but I know that you DP's is supposed to be good for games
  6:47am so that is landing in browsers now
  6:55site like any at good or polluted developer
  6:59I first time to just buy wristwatches so from forming
  7:02to get a head start nice place I and this is an extensive
  7:05and I expect more there are more jobs to apply grease out there now and this will
  7:09grow
  7:10I'm but is on the ones I came across an I knew that I wanted to do the project
  7:14in Johnston told bomb so I wanted night at the back end
  7:18I'm I found you know paired up Jess
  7:21seem to already do day so this may not be accurate neck
  7:25this may change orders may not be completely accurate because I was work
  7:27under a deadline
  7:28appear .gs seems to just two days if it does it very simply
  7:31very easily I'm simple awesome a simple
  7:35when RTC just did video and indeed I said I wanted both because I want yes
  7:38and
  7:39and messages saying I throwing the ball your face and that'll be the day spa
  7:43I'm ezer easy RTC I didn't look at because I found the
  7:47whether to seek a IR such as: was a nice
  7:50anode library became a client-side library just gonna drop 10
  7:54and the raid healing thing for me is there's a nice simple demo that was very
  7:57very hackable
  7:59I'm I got a prototype for this project operating in a couple hours
  8:02hacking that mr. I will show you in a moment
  8:06things extremely wary of is this is seek a new technology these are the versions
  8:11over
  8:11much as I was working with you know even 0.1 and
  8:15this is a very that the libraries are
  8:18evolving really quickly this point I'm so pretty sure I resign
  8:22I deployed a month ago already our date now there's been fixes like to see fixes
  8:27that
  8:28like applying myself site
  8:32that side this is my at this microsite and
  8:36site this is literally an hour's worth packing I justify severing I did stuff
  8:41my face on services screen casa modesto
  8:43and via face come from a fine
  8:47and the orientation events are being streamed from the fine
  8:50directly into the desktop and just doing sis is worse I
  8:53very simple and I would prefer concept like it though this game easily which
  8:57was a.m.
  8:59completely II underestimate him at work but
  9:02it it was a nice a perfect person a concept and
  9:06like I said the this was tax from the web RTC I O
  9:10demo and at my sympathies lie breezes it kinda levels out all the
  9:15different into our policy issues as
  9:18like several versions a pic the payday to
  9:21implementation as time went on and if you look at a car just got paid 800
  9:26or payday Tue or Wed get payday sarin and so on
  9:30and it does things like try to and sorrow between Fox's
  9:34and video in crimes videos well for you see I have to do that
  9:39yourself so that to replicate this this simply example is really only three
  9:43steps
  9:45first one is i'm craig room I'm for two people joining because I'm saying it's
  9:49you play game
  9:50I want some kind discover ability to say this is
  9:53times the game at a pink ice ice a drama pink eyes went 2-for-4
  9:56you join that will play against each other I'm you listen for my connections
  10:01coming in
  10:02and you would send your own video going up the Y and
  10:05again this is for the library so this isn't all the way down to the raw job's
  10:09going to show you something
  10:10bit for pretty straightforward here I'm
  10:13creating a a WebSockets a secure website K
  10:16and giving it a pin number sorry the room number basically
  10:20I'm sorry it has a connection wall size this limit event saying
  10:23on connected in and and loss that's happening are then
  10:28at an event listener to listen for when you stream comes in
  10:32so I get to see two objects coming and more my support the actual
  10:36video stream is that stream object and and
  10:39the the web of the CIO likely has a helper called
  10:42attached rain which give a stream given I development on the page
  10:46just put the two together but it's as simple as doing video source equals
  10:51Eurotop create you're a lot I
  10:54I've got us live in the moment the show you how to do that by hand and because
  10:58that we just put the effete together
  11:01and enterprise IT capture the video from your
  11:04your laptop or your final whatever device and send upstream as well
  11:08and this is all talks way for me so I just a RTC
  11:11great stream video yes or yes or no
  11:15I'm and Inc the case in my game because I want the opponents play some game and
  11:19not my own
  11:20I just throw away the actual streaming to do anything with it and
  11:22behind-the-scenes
  11:23the library spicy scent up the pay to pay and connection and its streaming it
  11:27to the other user
  11:29that set so lessons from a here we're live Reza
  11:33Civica when you fumbling your way through the actual card right there's
  11:36not a lot there and I've got a pretty sight working I've got paid up it takes
  11:39working already
  11:41I'm but the lesson here is libraries also hideaway in all the technology in
  11:45their box
  11:46in my coat that I hadn't realized even existed in the first place
  11:49and
  11:53my experience that's the right way to approach life you don't understand
  11:56technology taken like a result without
  11:59their thing and then understand what's going on is kinda
  12:02right long block west about using going beyond jQuery it's exactly how I was
  12:06thought was a Korean work my way back to
  12:08how all works and but the
  12:12the ready the big thing for me was pit a sourcing have this impression ahead to
  12:16peer to peer must be foster
  12:18I if if we try to hear fired up and at
  12:22the game running here what you want to connect to the game it would work out
  12:25the rock
  12:26whip on the same network savvy really quick but this game I wanted to work
  12:30between
  12:31you know the UK and US I want to be a play people over the
  12:34open web and that's not particularly foster
  12:38that still going a long way over the wire so
  12:42because my game already has a style of a senior and I don't wanna be
  12:45I'm not doing a Skype client or any send HD video down the wire it was in this
  12:49massive video down why
  12:51and so initially I don't think there's any way I've actually controlling how
  12:57much data goes over the wire
  12:58but you do have a way of saying here some options beyond
  13:02just saying true I i want video you can say I want
  13:05the max with a video to be and 160 Mike a site that the actual
  13:10gonna let them know video goes down why less tasers
  13:13if you need if you don't need much space is good right its last days on your
  13:17and mobile devices less by some other wire for your mobile device to
  13:22I'm process and I looks a
  13:25on my android lock them out they say that crime in concert with gigs worth
  13:28the days when I was testing
  13:29sorry imagine games with a Taser on a anong cell
  13:33network it's a an expensive
  13:36and so this is kinda and a no good one but you know I sup what you need
  13:42and in this I found a because I was eating in library
  13:45this didn't work I was getting at these arguments saying only serve this
  13:49160 video but inside the library realize the
  13:52it was just looking for the presence of a a value on video and if I had object
  13:56there too said
  13:57yes Teresa said the whole thing so sending by default 640 by 480
  14:01which isn't ready HD but it's a lot bigger than I needed but I can do it
  14:05yet poor question fix it but only found out after I finish with the
  14:08library
  14:12you pretty spot already that it's not entirely client side as well
  14:15I'm so you do need
  14:18you don't absolutely need to serve you can do entirely
  14:22and in the client's IP media no
  14:25what the IP address of the person trying to connect say and typically wanna be a
  14:29curse on a pin number or a collar to connect through right
  14:32so the game is and Japan you have that discover but I C
  14:36so you still need East only the server
  14:39and and literally this is all the car to have my set aside
  14:43I have not for the entire game for the web RTC paw
  14:47bygone express server once thats crazes I just wrap it up with the well TC
  14:52librarian the other liar is very similar just gonna wrap around your
  14:55your webserver may do the work for you by
  14:59in my live production car have no more than that to do with the
  15:02web RTC stuff it's just that one line so just Hamza for me
  15:06it create it handles creche enough rooms hand always
  15:09and tryna work out the discover bill is the part and
  15:12its it's all magic from my point of view and
  15:16if I wanted sad for back support for by West for instance that didn't have
  15:20the pic connection API I would use this socket see
  15:24send messages up to its when someone to defy so that the face
  15:27it would send up the WebSocket hey I was sent down to the connect to climb
  15:31and I could at fullback support using this Web Sockets
  15:36this is the interesting parts me the RTC taser channel
  15:40there's no commissions for this he just creia pace the connection
  15:43and at the moment there's a there's an options object that keep %ah Sen
  15:47the says either live out the true or local folks will I would surely means
  15:52you have a TCP connection
  15:54at which is a accord suspect is default so if your pasta nobody
  15:58you have a TCP connection reset reliable to force then
  16:01a crazy DP connection okay and I didn't really comment inside a San Carlos
  16:06that says that crime at the moment doesn't support
  16:09TCP reliable connections but it's quite likely
  16:12that fifty-some was watching this in the future I'm
  16:16that that's not true anymore aspects as quite likely that the comments already
  16:19outdated because is moving so quickly
  16:24if E if you guys and gals are already using WebSockets hope you're doing this
  16:28already actually test the WebSocket
  16:29open before you start trying to send data over that WebSocket you have to do
  16:33the same thing with the Thai
  16:34at the latest the data channel I'm in this case
  16:38i'm looking over my day channels and saying is the Ready state
  16:41open and is the no use if it's not the net the game is ready in the first place
  16:45right
  16:47the weird thing is the Ready state such as string whereas I'm going to use the
  16:50ready sets being mischievous
  16:51is just polished back I'm and hopefully you doing this website
  16:55anyway originally I wanted see stream the orientation events directly over the
  17:01page a set
  17:02API which would have I mean if you have a look says the orientation events just
  17:06it just bomb parts the device for tastes pours out
  17:10I'm and I was like wow that's a lot I said I'll throw
  17:13this in ninety send every turn 50 milliseconds which is
  17:16in the end is my point my those three states my game
  17:20the user is standing out there either left or the right left the rock
  17:24I'm so why don't you put the and meet the client's site so
  17:28instead of sending updates on having the pair workout they tilted left to right
  17:32just I by putting all the logic on the client side transcends little amount of
  17:36data over the wires possible
  17:38and in this case I say if the uses firing has tilted I was the right than a
  17:41status change
  17:42send that one message the pair case I you're still sending by serve
  17:46over the the Internet I had this misconception the payday so would be so
  17:51much faster and such
  17:52a social estate if it's it's not it's just close that there's no
  17:56there's that if we're in the same network been great but issues should be
  18:00over the wire
  18:02so just one explain the the mechanics this game before I kind of the
  18:07at show you that the biggest well like I hate
  18:10basically am before the game could start unit I need to open WebSocket the game
  18:15discovery
  18:16I'm connect to the video and audio stream once that was done our test if
  18:19the
  18:20at the pay is the pay connection was actually open I could talk to
  18:24is in the race day if that's the case in a game is ready the plane could propose
  18:28a chalice vice
  18:29site my game was a multi-page
  18:33website you be you you get this welcome pages had two bombs its gonna join a
  18:38game
  18:38all-star game if you ask start a game that it was
  18:42automatically create your own for you give your pin number and you can tell
  18:45your friend with a pin number is
  18:46and your friend was say a cameo join a game I'm
  18:50and parents the pen and when they hit refresh Owen hit submit
  18:54it goes this waiting state and at the start time we've been waiting state
  18:58hanging XHR on the set aside and when the service I it's
  19:02I'm a state machine went from
  19:05waiting to ready it would close the XHR quest
  19:08which a court both pages to reload into the the
  19:11play the game I once we're playing the game I then asked for the streams from
  19:15both uses at the same time
  19:17and try and connect them
  19:20but that didn't work I what happened is
  19:24I get to the game I see the video and instantly banish
  19:31so a get sick or water work out what was actually going on
  19:35I have analogy
  19:39I misplaced my wife doesn't detect so Chicago to
  19:43some hoping that you guys and girls gets well and if I don't just asking of
  19:46course
  19:47site this my analogy I wanna make a call to you
  19:51okay I've got my paper cup fine I'll both ends of my
  19:54my pickup the string in the pic above bomb and you have the same thing
  19:59I pick up some up to it my hand you the other end
  20:03and you do the same thing you put your bike up to up to you it and you have me
  20:06the other end
  20:07I'm II qet right I'll take that and I plucked my air intake uptake
  20:11of DA the end those hoping for and you do the same things like fine of
  20:16main put up to you it bring down the other end and with my standing there
  20:19with dangling fines or not act you talk to each other
  20:22we just saw this kind of long anything
  20:25no one's talking to each other the point is it's happening at the same time and
  20:29the
  20:29the connections were kinda missing each other now I don't know
  20:33because I haven't dug into this deep enough if this is a bug in
  20:37the like real I was using weather is a bug in the workflow
  20:41or what's more likely the it was a popular as him because the way I was
  20:45developing
  20:45and because the deadline I was against I need it's an easy life if you can I are
  20:49so I need a solution to get around this problem with the to use is trying to
  20:53connect the exact same time
  20:56so I create a single page app and what that
  20:59dates is I'm it
  21:03as soon as you go to start the game it would immediately ask you for your
  21:07your accordion video stream see so you're OK and you got a pin number they
  21:11say your friend has my pin number
  21:13and because that time delay between that place two points
  21:16the stream is already open its or the streams already being fed is that room
  21:21this imaginary room in the cloud or wherever is
  21:24they enter the PIN number because it happens not the same time it was some
  21:27delay
  21:28the night you can connect the property and there's no by if you try to connect
  21:31the same time
  21:33it worked that was the important
  21:39but there is some there is a point see a single page app
  21:42if you have credit at that at
  21:46when RTC stream or things like I'm full screen
  21:49and as soon as a pager Fresh's back is broken so once
  21:52if you if you app is in full screen mode when you hit refresh
  21:55it drops out for screen so these things that uses Cup assistance takes in the in
  22:00the browser
  22:01you might need to actually make a single page at the cum loads in each one of
  22:05these pages
  22:06now I only I my app is still might
  22:09site is still out the welcome page and then the rest is seeing page app
  22:13which meant that I can just at four screen I add a full swing right the and
  22:17I would like to have on the welcome screen guard for screen go to full
  22:20screen
  22:20and stop playing games because I have a fresh between welcome
  22:24and join I can do that
  22:27and also this could get annoying in your game I if you if you do
  22:30refresh the game so once once the games I V hit reloading the stock n
  22:36if you out SL the the desktop browsers 1 keep asking for Mitt prevention
  22:41to access the the webcam
  22:44on the mobile device this was surely when I start the project
  22:47and was forced by the time I need the projects as not white it took a long
  22:49time is pretty months with the death
  22:51because is working better the stuff changed on the FIF 8
  22:56I'm what happens on
  22:59and my bonus because no visual cue that there's a video stream
  23:03open on the phone they caught me always ask you for permission
  23:07okay on a desktop you have a light generally the tell you
  23:10webcams on on I'm a fine you have that and even better than I found the
  23:14I'm when I had no constraint to my phone off or put in standby mode
  23:18put it down walk away and forget that's back camera still on
  23:22and feeding a stream to the remote peer so you're fine can be of
  23:26and the camera was still be feeding they saw over the wire
  23:30makes a fine really recall
  23:35sigh I got bit I'm so about the graphics are things
  23:38um and I'm not I'm a developer
  23:41in terms if I i kno like black white and gray
  23:45thats as far as my graphic skills go and I'm not a 3d
  23:49programa and it kind of is a bit over mind fuck I'm
  23:54someone turns out the Southwest me and I knew that I had a 3d scene
  23:59I had to slow character in pakrats like their flight old school 80 strong style
  24:03near Florin youth repose into the that this 3d space it hit my face in
  24:08our original plan was to do this with songs like welcome to stay yes can on
  24:11that make it smaller and
  24:13be fine and I i sat down with them I all said lead lawyers speaking
  24:18I thing on Friday towards the end if you just gonna give me some advice on the 3d
  24:22stuff
  24:22and out first thing he said is night that's gonna be shipped and
  24:26probably not direct quote for and I need to use 30 chastity this work and I'm not
  24:31familiar enough with real chance so I
  24:33sat down with any chemical houses time in great this beautiful same or have the
  24:37sky 3d
  24:38at Florida caps is right place in all the perspective felt right as well like
  24:42my characters anti-big
  24:43for the the angle of the camera Sony look great
  24:46so when away with that information and I'm my or some
  24:5030 JS sane put on
  24:53a I'm a fine and the frames per second down about seven frames per second
  24:59everything was like a slow-motion
  25:01bolstering through the air is horribly horribly slow
  25:04I'm and if at this point I had two campuses on the screen and one video and
  25:07everything was going to complete crap
  25:09but even with one campus in 30 Jaz it just wasn't quick enough
  25:14during the initial an initial tests and this is on a Nexus 4's losses kind of
  25:19that
  25:19inherit product so start looking at the city's three runners
  25:24and but because I'm on an experimental browser that says Peter
  25:29on it it's not you know it's not a perfect I'll be working browser
  25:32I found the when my floor was in front of me completely
  25:35your flat it was fine buses attempted it forward into a 3d space
  25:39the Spanish and kinda problem
  25:43a but then it turned out that there was the park the
  25:46have been fixed over the weekend at the coming weekend I found the issue in
  25:50just text and but I decided not to use 3d render because I
  25:54I have a performance but the floor was missing so
  25:58I'm I found the actually the problem was I was rendering too much for campus
  26:03constantly on the screen I was doing I was doing my loop to
  26:06redraw the entire thing which includes like a big background
  26:09my character the ball and so-and-so I basie Kratie
  26:13to views I'm one was for the static background that got rendered once
  26:18or every now and then but needs to update background and once ever campus
  26:21that is as little as possible
  26:23spicy the ball to bounce down and three stores the face
  26:26and I found the pink tube videos and
  26:30a campus on a mobile phone is probably a pretty much with all the streams going
  26:34on
  26:34and when I had two videos the frame rates white right down
  26:38read one %uh videos because at the local video and if for some reason
  26:41nope just no good reason just to happen to be in the dome
  26:44took out and my friend might rights went back up to
  26:47I actually know about 50 frames per second on a
  26:51Nexus forces she's pretty good at the Nexus 7 on the other hand is little bit
  26:55at not us not strongly a
  26:59that from a site and but I have a lot of this
  27:03crank like hacking around with real Jasen and
  27:06or they are real-time stuff going on the same time and my rendering
  27:10and I would basically get this I just change something in
  27:14ever can was gonna lie I just move on
  27:18nice quite happy may have what I want to watch CSI I kept going
  27:22am some useful raise useful tips like I have said she was too great
  27:26matches to understand what's going to collide with something else the
  27:29collision detection
  27:30I had this debug views like to see where the ball was going in if the character
  27:34attempts left
  27:35occasionally that face thing which is going to launch off to the side in
  27:38I can see how to plug a mic ice is nice have a deep love you for that
  27:42three-part the game for the hardest part the entire game
  27:46was taking my mark my face and making it here at the right height with
  27:51in 3d space and Steven Wilson's is talking as well try to give me some help
  27:56in
  27:56in projecting 923 space there's a lot of ugly code that eventually did it and
  28:01Marsabit was 7 some some connelly from
  28:04esteem as well at 3d is not myspace I was good at that the real time stuff
  28:10this is really just school I'm but I'm in just a minute
  28:14and it take her life and it did end up to I'm
  28:19being shown a good liar and as one of the experiments
  28:22and but the the biggest lessons I go from this entire project
  28:26they won code base they actually to Nairobi planning based
  28:30I'm the that
  28:34the time touch you welcome such in new technology
  28:37at this point I'm there's not that much information out there was some good
  28:40videos but very deep dive
  28:42if at videos I'm I expect that to change with time
  28:47and the Google engineers are actually really good for all this new technology
  28:51want developers using the stuff and they will answer questions
  28:54and give you a hand I was really surprised at how much help I got
  28:57it wasn't you know they were right my card for me polygamy feedback and
  29:00suggestions
  29:01Pokemon help me with that the the same page app solution
  29:05he was looking at any manager work out where is happening and
  29:08and and back she said I need to move to single-page apertures
  29:11a pain but you know I did it I'm
  29:14the biggest thing was maybe the horse came for the car like
  29:17and I think I focused in law on the technology and didn't really think too
  29:21much about gays mechanic that the game
  29:23mechanics I'm not hun Sen sure if it's a good game
  29:27I could have quite easily test to the game without any the technology
  29:31but I focused on that tack and I have a game is playable
  29:34and its cold as a demo but whether it's light was
  29:37addictive games I'm not too sure and
  29:43I really would love to say whether RTC's really ready for prime time iced
  29:47don't think it's quite there yet for developers
  29:50Obama does say check the expiry date but that's going to change quickly
  29:54and I'm I'm pretty sight in 12 months time we will be a place where we could
  29:57quite happily use
  29:59web RTC and big projects and I was seeing a lot more
  30:02I'm confident we'll see a more places the resources will
  30:06the be more tutorials spring costs more talks on
  30:10I want to say and
  30:14my boss looking pretty pretty good Microsoft support I have no clue what's
  30:18going on that side on a warrant or policies going to look like
  30:22I'm but it works
  30:25so you know your ass I'm
  30:29I want to help a high note so that's kind of at my the my way of saying we
  30:33will see is actually pretty cool to play with
  30:35but it's making a playground at the moment
  30:38I'm there's Code Ann all the source codes online seeking can't help myself
  30:43don't judge me too much and when you gonna light wall wall
  30:46re what where the comments that kinda thing and
  30:49their test that coming in and but its
  30:52its online you can to play at I don't think I've got time for questions but
  30:57you can kind of
  30:58ask me anything later on I'm sure love affair my hand some point Alana
  31:02I'm say without my times up in thanks listening
