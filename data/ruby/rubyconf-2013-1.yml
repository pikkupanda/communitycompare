  0:16Thank you for coming
  0:18and Ruby Conf is always great
  0:23and a keynote make me depressed (laughs)
  0:32You know I&#39;m a programmer
  0:33I&#39;m a language designer
  0:35so you know, my main tasks should be is designinglanguage
  0:42a great language
  0:43I admit that I did great things
  0:48you know
  0:49that influenced
  0:51so many people all around the world
  0:54including you guys
  0:55so I&#39;m pretty happy with it
  0:57but still
  0:59you know
  1:1I&#39;m not really a great presenter
  1:4nor
  1:10I&#39;m very
  1:11I&#39;m not really good at english
  1:19that always makes me nervous
  1:21anyway, today I&#39;m going to talk about thefantasy land
  1:26ok
  1:29this way
  1:30fantasy land
  1:33that is a place being away from reality
  1:37the where the unicorn lives
  1:43in Japanese it is called
  1:44genjitsu-tohi
  1:46which is escaping from reality
  1:49my dictionary says that is escapism
  1:50is that correct word or something
  1:53so for example
  1:55so the starting cleanup right before the deadline
  2:0is kinda like escapism
  2:5starting debuging mruby right before the keynote
  2:8is escapism
  2:10that is what I did
  2:12so today
  2:14I&#39;m going to talk about
  2:16oh excuse me
  2:19two fantasy lands
  2:21the first one is kinda like a distopia
  2:26in 1990
  2:29I graduated from university
  2:31I feel old
  2:36I was hired by a software development company
  2:39which does, which did some kind of enterprisesoftware
  2:43in that, that age
  2:48the software development is totally differentfrom now
  2:52so we had some kind of three year projector something
  2:58from the huge company or huge government department
  3:4we had some kind of analysis for months oreven years
  3:9then we wrote some kind of very detailed documentation
  3:13this abstract documentation
  3:14the detailed documentation
  3:16then we code
  3:19which is the translation from natural languageto computer language
  3:26so the process was driven by waterfall process
  3:30so the company&#39;s decision was very, very,very conservative
  3:36so at that time I felt something was wrong
  3:42but I couldn&#39;t explain why
  3:43just because it was so natural
  3:47everyone was doing it that way in softwaredevelopment
  3:50back then
  3:52so I couldn&#39;t explain why
  3:56everyone was doing that
  3:57it is quit difficult to tell what is wrong
  4:1when everyone is doing bad things
  4:4right
  4:5so yea I couldn&#39;t imagine what was right andwhat was wrong
  4:10so after more than 20 years of experience
  4:14I was a pretty experienced programmer
  4:15ah maybe
  4:16now I understand, I now understand what waswrong
  4:23we were wrong in software development
  4:26that depends on some false assumptions
  4:31we were depending on such false assumptions
  4:37assumption number one
  4:39we know what we make
  4:42back then we believed we are knowing whatwe are going to make
  4:49in reality we don&#39;t know what software is
  4:54so software does not have any physical entity
  4:59so it is not limited by physical law
  5:3so it can be very, very easily complex
  5:8so, for example, if I were a building architect
  5:17so I design a building like this hotel
  5:21so we need to think about, for example
  5:25about weather, or the strengths of the concrete,
  5:31or iron, or something, the building materials
  5:37then the strength of the building itself canbe
  5:42calculated by physically, easily simulated
  5:47but you know
  5:50when we starting developing software it iseasy, like
  5:55&quot;hello world&quot;
  5:57that&#39;s quite easy
  5:57there is no room for bug
  5:59but the software is getting bigger and bigger
  6:3so it&#39;s quite difficult to understand say10,000 lines of code
  6:9but now days software is so huge
  6:14like if I had a Prius here, it is an automobile,
  6:24it has tons of lines of code, maybe hundredsof lines of code, tons of hundreds
  6:30maybe millions of code
  6:32so it&#39;s like, as a software developer, youcan imagine how difficult to ensure no bugs
  6:41in the millions of lines of code
  6:44yeah
  6:45I&#39;m sure I cannot do that
  6:46so, the software can be a most complex creation,maybe
  6:54and no document but code can explain the details
  6:59so the, we believe we knew what we were goingto make
  7:6but in reality, we didn&#39;t
  7:9false assumption number two, which is
  7:12we know what we want
  7:16in reality, it&#39;s quite difficult to imagine
  7:19you know, in a waterfall age I write a code(?? 00:07:27.16) with sophistication
  7:27and I give that sophistication to our client
  7:31then clients said, OK, then we started development
  7:37a few weeks, few months, few years later
  7:41the software was finished
  7:43then I wrote
  7:44if we wrote it to the client, then
  7:49can you imagine what the client said?
  7:53it&#39;s not what I wanted
  7:54but, they said yes, this is OK
  8:0but, afterwards, they said, this is not whatI wanted
  8:6even, I admit, I said OK
  8:11but, you know, we couldn&#39;t imagine what thesoftware appears in reality
  8:19so, like a stupid boss says ?? (00:08:23.56)to the client
  8:28yeah, I complained a lot
  8:31I happened to complain so often, back then
  8:34but one day, I asked my colleague to createsome kind of software
  8:43at that time I was so busy, so I
  8:46I explained what I want to my colleague
  8:49then he created the software, then back tome
  8:52and I said, this is not what I wanted! (laughs)
  8:57stupid me
  9:1I said I don&#39;t know why we should make toomaximize business value
  9:6we couldn&#39;t, no, we couldn&#39;t understand whatis gonna bring you success
  9:15so we are stupid, too
  9:20so, false assumption number three
  9:23which is
  9:24the situation will not be changed
  9:27in reality, we don&#39;t know the future
  9:33we&#39;re not prophets
  9:36we have wrong forecasts
  9:38so yeah, in this technology field, we havea lot of
  9:46we&#39;re gonna have this technology, we&#39;re gonnahave this, too
  9:50we&#39;re gonna conquer the world, so
  9:53most forecasts will be wrong
  9:57so let&#39;s face it
  9:58we don&#39;t know anything
  9:5920 years ago
  10:3we should have admitted our ignorance, butwe couldn&#39;t
  10:7so instead, we ignored our ignorance
  10:11so, when we know little, we have very fewchoices, so
  10:18choice number one is a conservative strategy
  10:23learn from the past
  10:23so, this is very good strategy
  10:29and the politicians often take
  10:32conservative
  10:34but it is pretty good unless factors don&#39;tchange
  10:40unfortunately not in the IT industry, so
  10:44we change a lot, the situation will changedrastically, day by day
  10:50so, in our industry it&#39;s kind of like thequote from Red Queen in Alice in Wonderland
  11:2&quot;Now, here, you see, it takes all the runningyou can do, to keep in the same place.
  11:9If you want to get somewhere else, you mustrun at least twice as fast as that!&quot;
  11:16It&#39;s our situation, here
  11:21probably, yeah
  11:25it&#39;s our situation
  11:26we have to run as fast as we can to be inthe same place
  11:32so, strategy number two is
  11:36ostrich algorithm
  11:37in the ostrich algorithm
  11:43so when the sandstorm comes, ostrich dig intheir head into sand
  11:49and wait until the sandstorm ends
  11:53so the, the ostrich strategy is ignore everything,and wait
  11:58it is a good strategy
  12:8only when situations will recover
  12:11so sandstorms will end
  12:13so, we will have the clear skies and we
  12:21we can enjoy our climate again
  12:26but, you know, in our industry
  12:31that&#39;s not going to happen
  12:32where the situation will change and changeand change and not recover
  12:36so we, we cannot go back to the main frames
  12:42we can go back to the, you know, eighty, fiftyyears or something
  12:47so we must keep forward, keep going forward
  12:52so the ostrich algorithm is very good strategyin the past
  12:59when the situation will recover
  13:1so the, this strategy, this algorithm, iswritten in our instincts
  13:6so we are so easy to choose that strategy
  13:10but, otherwise, when the situation will notrecover
  13:19it&#39;s kind of like the living in the fantasyland
  13:21so, going forward with false assumptions iskind of like living in the fantasy land
  13:28so, ignoring reality
  13:36we had two strategies
  13:38conservative strategy and ostrich algorithm
  13:42which strategy do we take?
  13:45neither of them are good
  13:4820 years ago
  13:50our goal was to create the software, somehow
  13:56having computerized system is the power
  13:59it is so powerful, the computer itself isso powerful, comparing to the human creation
  14:5??(00:14:05.13)
  14:6so it has great power, so software developmentwas pretty expensive back then
  14:12the computers were expensive
  14:14the network connection was expensive
  14:16the failure never be allowed in that age
  14:21so they needed to optimize, not to fail
  14:26at the cost of satisfaction
  14:28so I don&#39;t care you are satisfied our softwareor not
  14:33but I can re-use some kind of the power ofcomputers with that computerized system
  14:42so everyone was dreaming
  14:44we believed that the only way to create software
  14:48we tried hard to believe that was the onlyway
  14:52but 20 years later, now
  14:54our goal is not really, not just create asoftware
  15:0our goal is to create the great software
  15:2you know, nowadays everyone has computer,everyone uses software
  15:9so, mere possession is no longer the power
  15:15everyone has computer, everyone has software
  15:17so we&#39;re saved
  15:19to differentiate, to have the power over others
  15:24we need to create great software, we needgreat software
  15:30we got to create great software, but how?
  15:36of course we don&#39;t know
  15:38we have made false assumptions
  15:40admit our ignorance
  15:42but, but there&#39;s good news, there&#39;s good news
  15:46the computers are cheaper
  15:49cloud computing is even cheaper
  15:52a network connection is cheaper now
  15:54and ubiquitous
  15:55everyone has imagination
  15:57even in this room
  16:0software development is cheaper
  16:1comparing to twenty-something years ago
  16:4so, we can be more productive, more abstract
  16:8and we now have better tools and a betterlanguage
  16:12like Ruby
  16:24and we have a lot of open source software
  16:26so we can rely on that kind of software
  16:29we can learn from that software
  16:31so, old days, it is quite difficult to studyfrom the real source source code ?? (00:16:41.91)
  16:44if you would like to learn about the operatingsystem
  16:50so you cannot access to the source code of,say, Microsoft Windows
  16:59or the ?? (00:17:00.68) or some other operatingsystem
  17:4you, you can access through Linux?? (00:17:08.34)
  17:9or the very old version of Linux
  17:12but not the real software
  17:15but nowadays you can access the Linux
  17:18a whole bunch of Linux code and you have tonsof operating systems
  17:23and that is used in reality
  17:27and
  17:29you can use some software in your system
  17:33you can learn from that source code
  17:37so it&#39;s much easier for us to learn and createthe great software
  17:46and we can now have the collaboration viainternet
  17:49it&#39;s, it&#39;s changed the game
  17:55so, 20 years ago, soon after I graduated theuniversity
  18:0I was at the point I was working as a professionalprogrammer in enterprise software
  18:7I was prohibit to write email abroad, outsideJapan
  18:14only 20 years ago - not two hundred yearsago
  18:18so, yeah, I, when I was a university student
  18:26I wrote some kind of software, free software
  18:28it was distributed by, it was quite minor,you know client on top of ?? (00:18:32.73)
  18:36and, I got to mail from some other guys, probablyin the States
  18:43I don&#39;t remember quite
  18:46but
  18:47I tried to reply, and soon after that I goterror mail
  18:52your company did not pay money to the internetconnection
  19:0international internet connection, I mean
  19:4so, I forwarded that reply to my friend inthe university
  19:10the university pay that kind of bill so thathe could receive the mail
  19:19it was quite awkward corresponding, you know
  19:23he wrote mail to me then I did not respond
  19:26so that, the friend respond because of meor something like that
  19:30but, you know, now we can connect to everyoneall over the world
  19:37so we can access through Japan, China, Moscow,everywhere
  19:44so we can now collaborate over the internet
  19:47so, that allows us to do some kind of socialcoding, so
  19:55so, GitHub changed everything
  19:59so these good things bring up the new fantasyland
  20:7the new perspective
  20:9so we can ignore gory detail of the hardwareor the
  20:17and the new operating system, for most ofthe cases
  20:21we can stand on the shoulders of giants, sowe can use the great huge software
  20:28of the operating system, framework, language,the tools, editors
  20:36so a lot of the things
  20:37so we can do great things with very littleeffort, comparing to the past
  20:45so we can do greater work than our real ability,real power
  20:54so, I think the genius 20 years ago does notrecur enough, is not strong enough
  21:4they are almost fame ?? (00:21:05.97), theability as a human, in genius
  21:9but, now, we can rely, we can collaborate,we can collaborate over internet
  21:16we can collaborate on top of open source software,free software, so
  21:22we can do greater works than our past
  21:26but that does not mean we are greater
  21:30so the situation has changed
  21:32we can have power, we can have more freedom
  21:38we can have more joy in software
  21:40so I remember that the, working on the enterprisessoftware was not fun
  21:48so, it&#39;s quite boring, so translating humansophistication
  21:55in human language into the computer languagewas so boring
  22:1you know, that sophistication once said that,OK, assign this value to this variable
  22:7or something like that, so
  22:10why these kind of genius don&#39;t write the codeby themselves?
  22:18it was quite boring when I was ?? (00:22:49.51)
  22:22so now, we can do by ourselves, we can havejoy in our programming
  22:29it&#39;s kind of like engineers&#39; heaven
  22:31that&#39;s where we are, and that&#39;s why we arehere
  22:36but wait, it&#39;s still not real
  22:44in reality is as conflict as past
  22:49so, who maintains this fantasy land?
  22:55in reality, we cannot just ignore mess, sowe don&#39;t need
  23:0something, so, we can ignore or just forget
  23:8but something&#39;s got to maintain this kindof a mess
  23:14so, it&#39;s, so somebody&#39;s got to work on thatkind of mess
  23:23garbage collectors
  23:25no, that&#39;s not the garbage that you imagine
  23:29for that kind of topic you can go to to theKoichi talk
  23:37so, by the term garbage collector, I meantthis (picture)
  23:43and, we have to rely on this kind of peoplein our daily life
  23:51even in our programming
  23:55without them, we would become mess
  24:0so welcome to the desert of reality
  24:2we rely on garbage collectors
  24:6so we&#39;d better appreciate them
  24:10we rely on a lot of garbage collectors whokeep the fantasy land
  24:19who created your favorite language?
  24:22the garbage collector
  24:25or, who created your favorite gems?
  24:30gem creators, raise your hands
  24:34you have to appreciate them (applause)
  24:38thank you
  24:43who created your favorite frameworks?
  24:47who wrote your favorite books? book writers,raise your hand (applause)
  24:57who created your opensource software, we havetons of open source software
  25:5in and out our Ruby community
  25:7so we have to appreciate them
  25:9so appreciation and respect is the key, Ibelieve
  25:15the key to the open source community
  25:19the key to the moving forward
  25:22so open source community is kind of like ashark
  25:24(laughs)
  25:25we need to keep moving forward, or die
  25:35(applause)
  25:36so, we have to, and I would advise to you,keep moving forward
  25:44so you have to run as fast as you can to stayin the same place
  25:51and you have to run twice as fast as thatto move forward
  25:59so run fast, try often, fail early
  26:4keep moving forward, yes, that is my message
  26:8and in addition, appreciation is not enough
  26:11so, we are not creative to the gem writers
  26:18we are not creative to the language designer
  26:22we are not creative to the open source softwareprogrammers
  26:29so we became one
  26:32so, take the red pill
  26:41so, you can come join us
  26:45if you are a programmer, that&#39;s fine, that&#39;sfine you&#39;re a programmer
  26:49you take a great step to create something
  26:54you know, the programmer is a creator
  26:57so, you create software, then by your creation
  27:5the world will be better, I hope, I reallywill hope
  27:9the world will be better by your creation
  27:12you programmers, you create soft ware, andyou make the world better
  27:18but, but you might still living in the fantasyland
  27:27which is kept by the garbage collectors
  27:31and if you&#39;re willing, I&#39;m not forcing you
  27:37if you&#39;re willing, you can be one of them
  27:40you can be a garbage collector
  27:44you don&#39;t want?
  27:46but this garbage collector is much cleaner
  27:49so, be a garbage collector, take part in keepingthe fantasy land
  27:56so this fantasy land, unlike the first one,which ignores everything
  28:4so this fantasy land, we currently enjoy isour result of the effort of the long time
  28:15maybe twenty, forty, fifty years of the greateffort of the garbage collectors
  28:20so, I, I invite you guys to take part in keepingthe fantasy land
  28:33and for example, so you can join the CRuby
  28:38even in writing some reporting some issuesthe bug trackers or something like that
  28:46so, once you know what we garbage collectorsdoing behind the CRuby
  28:54you can take the, that session
  29:4so, again, so I ask you to create a greatfantasy land
  29:18currently we enjoy, and it can be even greaterwith your effort
  29:25so you can do as much, many things, so writingsoftware on top of Ruby on Rails
  29:30or the ?? (00:22:49.51) or something likethat
  29:32that will enrich the community and communicatewith blogs, twitter and social net, social
  29:41coding
  29:41or even, participate in the community, likethe GitHub is our friend
  29:49you can do many things, submit bugs, writedocuments on the
  29:55you know, have a presentation in the conference,you can
  29:58or, write a small piece of software, writea part in the, submit a ?? (00:31:05.62)
  30:5so, so many things you can do, but in anyway create
  30:11and try to keep a great fantasy land thatwe enjoy
  30:16change the world
  30:16so, I believe we&#39;ve changed the world in betterways
  30:24in the past, say, ten years, so
  30:29a lot of people in this conference, in thepast Ruby conferences
  30:33so presented the great things, so now I expecteven more great work will be introduced in
  30:44this conference
  30:48so do not be a just a listener
  30:55do not be a passive receiver of information
  31:1so you hear something in this conference,you learn something, take action
  31:11change the world
  31:12so, this is the key of the open source community
  31:19this is the key of the Ruby community, so
  31:25I know myself, I&#39;m not a great programmer
  31:29so, especially the Ruby commuters in the leagueknows I&#39;m not a great programmer
  31:40I create so many bugs
  31:46but, but still, I could, I did great job thatinfluenced the world
  31:57and I respect myself by changing the worldbetter
  32:3so I believe you can do that too in someways
  32:9so change the world
  32:10thank you
  32:11domo arigato
